        • Refactored the SIRS model ‘pomp’ object.

        • The ‘obscure’ operation now drops single-child internal nodes
          in addition to erasing all deme information.

        • Corrected certain inconsistencies in the way the
          lineage-count table was reported and used in pomp objects.
          The ‘lbdp_pomp’ and ‘sir_pomp’ functions assume a particular
          form of the lineage count table, such that every entry
          corresponds to either a root, a branch point, or a sample
          (but NB, the last entry is treated differently).  This
          assumption was violated beginning with version 0.2.0.0 in
          that the lineage count table returned by ‘lineages()’
          contained an entry for internal nodes.  Now, when
          ‘obscure=TRUE’ (the default), the behavior is as it was
          before, consistent with the assumptions of ‘lbdp_pomp’ and
          ‘sir_pomp’
