        • The option to generate “non-compact” Newick-format tree
          representations has been removed: all Newick representations
          are now in the “compact” format.  In this format, each node
          has a color indicated by a letter immediately following its
          closing parenthesis: this is ‘b’ if the node holds a blue
          ball (i.e., it represents a sample) and ‘g’ otherwise.
          Information about the node's deme and its name are provided
          as well.

        • Previously, the Newick formatter employed “invisible” nodes
          to assist in the formatting of plots.  As of this release,
          they no longer contain such nodes: the generated Newick
          strings now accurately represent the forest of trees
          corresponding to the genealogy process.  The proper
          formatting for plots is accomplished within the plotting
          routines themselves.

        • Refactored the SIRS model ‘pomp’ object.

        • The ‘obscure’ operation now drops single-child internal nodes
          in addition to erasing all deme information.

        • Corrected certain inconsistencies in the way the
          lineage-count table was reported and used in pomp objects.
          The ‘lbdp_pomp’ and ‘sir_pomp’ functions assume a particular
          form of the lineage count table, such that every entry
          corresponds to either a root, a branch point, or a sample
          (but NB, the last entry is treated differently).  This
          assumption was violated beginning with version 0.2.0.0 in
          that the lineage count table returned by ‘lineages()’
          contained an entry for internal nodes.  Now, when
          ‘obscure=TRUE’ (the default), the behavior is as it was
          before, consistent with the assumptions of ‘lbdp_pomp’ and
          ‘sir_pomp’
