## To-do List

- GP simulations are not fully reproducible: why?
- deme-specific lineage functions
- improve `newick2df` for use with more general formats
- include `code` column in `lineage_count`
- list structure natively (rather than via `read_yaml`)
- routines to get trees, diagrams separately from `getInfo`
- brown balls?
