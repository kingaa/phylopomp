## To-do List

- facility for extracting multiple trees, diagrams, etc, from a single simulation
  - should be capable of extracting information at selected time-points
- repair newick2df
- output on model-specific states, parameters to YAML, describe, and structure formats
- GP simulations are not fully reproducible: why?
- deme-specific lineage functions
- improve `newick2df` for use with more general formats
- include `code` column in `lineage_count`
- brown balls?
- segmented virus simulator
