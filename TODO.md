## To-do List

- single C++ interface to plot, diagram, lineage, etc.
  - this should be hidden below the R level
  - facility for extracting multiple trees, diagrams, etc, from a single simulation
  - should be capable of extracting information at selected time-points
  - routines to get trees, diagrams separately from `getInfo`
- repair Newick
- output on model-specific states, parameters to YAML, describe, and structure formats
- GP simulations are not fully reproducible: why?
- deme-specific lineage functions
- improve `newick2df` for use with more general formats
- include `code` column in `lineage_count`
- brown balls?
- segmented virus simulator
